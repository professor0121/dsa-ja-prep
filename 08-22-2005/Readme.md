## 1. Given two positive integer arrays arr and brr, find the number of pairs such that xy > yx (raised to power of) where x is an element from arr and y is an element from brr.
```sh
Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 6], brr[] = [1, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The pairs which follow xy > yx are: 21 > 12,  25 > 52 and 61 > 16 .
Input: arr[] = [2 3 4 5], brr[] = [1 2 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: The pairs which follow xy > yx are: 21 > 12 , 31 > 13 , 32 > 23 , 41 > 14 , 51 > 15 .
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size(), brr.size() ≤ 104
1 ≤ arr[i], brr[i] ≤ 103

```
## 2. Given an array of integers arr[]. You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 
```sh
Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 0
Explanation: As the sequence is already sorted so there is no inversion count.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 0
Explanation: As all the elements of array are same, so there is no inversion count.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
```
## 3. Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.
```sh
Note: You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2
